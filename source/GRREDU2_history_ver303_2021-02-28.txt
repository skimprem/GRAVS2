GRREDU2 history

vers. 303 (2021-02-28)
- improving the headers and informative text of output files, correcting the log text, addition of help text to batch script
- the conversion of fortran source code from ANSI to UTF-8 and few chamges to make source compilable in linux with gfortran
- in case of unknown height value shoud be -9999 (-999 was used before)
- air pressure value within the interval 900, 1100 hPa is not checked anymore, but the difference btw the air pres and spn (standard pressure) is checked, if it is over 100 hPa (height error about ~834 m) then error code with exit

vers. 302 (2020-03-20)
- the correction of many bugs: lcali=f gives zero readings, g and rdng, if vgg2 has integer value etc)

vers. 300 (2019-07-10)
- new coordinate file format, two last columns now include 2 parameters (vgg1 vgg2) for modeling the vertical gravity change, see Ch. 1.3.4 in Manual
- a piecewise linear function was added to model and predict the time-dependent scale change of gravimeter
- the update of subroutine ETMUTC.f to add the latest leap-second in 2016, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second

vers. 276 (2010-05-12)
- The faulty algorithm of polynomial calibration correction was corrected (was added with opposite sign)
- the algorithm of polar motion was updated according to the new format of IERS eopc04.*-now
- lots of small modifications, include statements were corrected

vers. 275 (2010-05-09)
- New *.obs file format possible, without temperature and humidity information (without three last columns),
Scintrex CG5 *.txt file preprocessor sform2 (*.txt -> *.obs) was modified too.
- empty lines (at least 8 blanks at the beginning) now allowed in *.obs file list and in other input files
 
Vers. 274 (2010-03-07)
- the interval 900, 1100 hPa allowed for air pressure value. If its value -999.9 (lpres=t) then lpres=f.
- if the height value of gravimeter is -999 (lfair=t) then -> lfair=f
- the columns with corrections were shifted to correct position

Vers. 2.7 (Dec 2009)
- 2008->2009 leap second included, SUBROUTINE ETMUTC updated, 2009.00000D0 (JD 2454832.500000D0)-> ET-UTC= 66.184D0 s
- Only part of LCR calibration file (by manufacturer) now needed in LCRmeter.cal
- The polynomial part of calibration function (by user) included
- Lots of minor corrections

Vers. 2.6 (2008-11-12)
- Erroneous computation of calibration function corrected
- Modifications of iclude statements

Vers. 2.5 (2008-10-20)
- The format of date and time changed, old GRAVSOFT format 181008 12.545 now 2008-10-18 12:54:30 (new subroutine MJD2)

Vers. 2.4 (2007-06-01)
- The change of the format of the output file *.redu
- pcoef read-in parameter now (suggested -0.3 [uGal/hPa])
- normal pressure computation included, no rnp needed for every point anymore (replaced by rgdot, see below)
- the correction for gravity change in time included and tested, the constant rate of change rgdot value (uGal/yr) for every station needed
- The reference epoch as new read-in parameter to convert all readings to the same epoch

Vers. 2.3 (2004-11-12)
- Ability to read in multiple observation files
- Optimisation of the computation tidal correction and also other algorithms
- Inclusion statements etc.

Vers. 2.2 (2004-08)
- For tidal correction the algorithms from ETGTAB software (930821, H.-G. Wenzel) were implemented and tested
- the tidal potential development by TAMURA (1987) with 1200 waves was chosen as default
- the adaptation of GTPAR program with GRREDU2 (for estimation of tidal parameters).
- LCR G meter calibration table separated from source code
- the correction for polar motion included

Vers. 2.1 (2004-06-18)
- The computation of periodic part of the user's calibration function (for LCR meters)
- Separate file for the gravimeter's info (sensor height, user's cal.function)


Vers. 2.0 (2002-12-07)
- Computation of corrections to taken account the changes of gravimeter's height and atm.pressure
- Data of all kind of gravimeters can be processed (not only LCR or Scintrex)

Etc.
