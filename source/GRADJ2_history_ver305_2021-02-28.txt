GRADJ2 history

vers. 305 (2021-02-28)
- improving the headers and informative text of output files, correcting the log text
- addition of help text to batch script
- the conversion of fortran source code from ANSI to UTF-8, the replacaments of faulty symbols and characters
- few changes to make source compilable in linux with gfortran

vers. 304 (2021-02-05)
- the update of intro in source code, correcting the naming of input parameters
- the separate output file *.ties.adj for adjusted gravity differences
- renaming of residual file: resid -> resid4hist.dat, and the file with mean readings, residuals per site occupation: *.res2 -> *.resi.mean
- the correcton of log text

vers. 300 (2020-03-17)
- the computation of AIC, BIC
- the correction of bugs

vers. 298 (2019-07-26)
- increased dimentions of arrays for Estonian gravity network adjustment: maxfile=150 -> 500, maxobs=15000 -> 25000

vers. 297 (2011-01-20)
- separate input file to introduce fixed gravity values into the adjustment
- new parameter sc_std to scale the variances, see Ch. 2.4.3 in Manual
- batch file (*.bat) upgrade

vers. 296 (2010-08-20)
- the algorithm for the standard deviations of gravity differences in *.cov file was corrected
- include statements were corrected
- other minor corrections

vers. 295 (2010-03-26)
- for the weighting two separate options in *.par files now available: w(eight) and u(ncertainty) (see the header of source code)
- RMS, WRMS computation for every set (consistent obs. period with same drift, in general one day long) in *.redu, *.redu2 files

vers. 294 (2010-03-16)
- the calibration with polynomial function now correct (before it did not work because the interference between scale factor and polynomial).
Now user has to choose whether to use scale factor (nonlinear problem!) or polynomial.
- Problem: with higher order polynomial extremely big numbers possible in normal matrix which may cause imprecise computation and convergence problems.
It would be helpful to change rbias value and use mode "vmode=t" to improve and follow the normal matrix computation.
- improved help text at the header
- now it can read empty lines (at least 8 blanks at the beginning) from the most input files

vers. 293 (2009-12-14)
- The standard deviations of amplitude A and phase phi of periodical calibration function are computed now based on the x, y st.dev's and cov elements
- The subroutine CHINV2 modification -> CIHNV2m
- The normal matrix, its inversion and covariance matrix computations were tested with parallel computation in GNU Octave (numerical computation software).

vers. 291 (2009-12-14)
- Problem with weight matrix computation, fixed points were weighted according to the SIGMA2 (aposteriori st.dev of unit weight) which was changed during the iteration process. That was causing wrong results thus apriori st.dev (SIGMA1) is now used for the scale factor of weight matrix only.
- The default standard deviation for all readings of relative gravimete(s) was introduced in *.proj file, before its value was 1.0

vers. 2.8 (2008-11-13)
- The adjusted gravity differences and their st.deviations between all points in *.cov file
- New *.resi2 file which contains averaged readings, time etc of every observation session in *.resi2
- based on averaged readings unadjusted gravity differences in *.ties file
- now possible to comment out lines in *.proj file (e.g. for removing temporarily fixed points), in *.par files (removing constraints), in *.cal file

vers. 2.7 (2008-10-20)
- The format of date and time changed, old GRAVSOFT format 181008 12.545 -> 2008-10-18 12:54:30

vers. 2.6 (June 2008)
- Modified to read new GRREDU2 (vers. 2.5) format

Vers. 2.5 (June 2006 - July 2007)
- the computation of full COV(X) - the covariance matrix of adjusted parameters, and COV(res) - the main diagonal of the cov matrix of residuals
- the computation of standard residuals ja redundancies for every reading
- statistical testing of results: t-, tau-, X^2- tests
- the skipping of groups of readings with option s in *.par file (e.g. s11-20 removes readings with seq.nr 11-20 from the adjustment)
- The computation of WRMS in *.resi file

Etc.
